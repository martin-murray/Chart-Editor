Date Picker – Quick Ranges & CTA Layout Update
1. Add Quick Ranges dropdown

In the custom date picker, move all the existing preset range CTAs into a single dropdown to keep the unit compact.

Dropdown title/label: Quick Ranges

Dropdown options:

Single Trading Day

This Week

Last Week

This Month

Last 3 Months

Behaviour:

When a user selects a Quick Range:

Automatically set the start and end dates in the date picker.

Update the “Selected” summary text (see section 2).

Do not immediately apply — the user still confirms via Apply Date Range.

2. Move main CTA + selected range summary

After a date range is selected (via manual date pick or Quick Range), the main call-to-action needs to appear in the top-right of the date picker.

Layout in the top right:

Selected range text on one line:

Format:
Selected: MMM DD, YYYY – MMM DD, YYYY
Example: Selected: Nov 01, 2024 – Jan 10, 2025

Duration text on the next line (or inline, depending on layout):

Format:
(XX days)
Example: (45 days)

Primary button underneath or next to it:

Label: Apply Date Range

3. Date cell states & styling (Today / Selected / Hover)

We need to fix confusion around today’s date looking like it’s already selected.

a. Today (default, not selected)

Still visually highlighted, but not filled.

Style:

Border: 1px solid white

Corner radius: 4px

Background: same as calendar background

Text: unchanged (normal date text colour)

Purpose: “This is today” without implying it’s the active selected date.

b. Selected date(s)

Any clicked date or in-range date (start/end or full range highlight):

Background: solid #5AF5FA

Text colour: #121212

This should clearly read as the active selection, distinct from today’s subtle outline.

c. Hover / focused state (for any date cell)

On hover or keyboard focus:

Background: #1C1C1C

Text colour: #F7F7F7

This hover/focus style should apply consistently, including over today’s date or dates not yet selected.

4. Behaviour summary for the AI

Move all range shortcuts into a Quick Ranges dropdown inside the custom date picker (Single Trading Day, This Week, Last Week, This Month, Last 3 Months).

Show the selected range and total days in the top-right: Selected: MMM DD, YYYY – MMM DD, YYYY and (XX days), with a primary button labeled Apply Date Range.

Today’s date: 1px white border, 4px radius, no fill.

Selected dates: background #5AF5FA, text #121212.

Hover/focus: background #1C1C1C, text #F7F7F7.
