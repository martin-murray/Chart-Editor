Prompt: Fix Chart History Save + Ticker Tag Position
1. Bug: Chart History Log isn’t saving charts

Problem

The Chart History Log is not saving my current chart state.

Repro example:

Base ticker: (whatever is selected)

I add a comparison ticker: ARGX

Date range selected: Custom → Aug 20, 2025 – Sep 02, 2025

The ARGX line does appear on the chart when I use presets like 1D, 5D, 2W, 1M, 3M, 6M, so the data is clearly loading.

But the Chart History Log does not create/update a card for this chart.

Expected behaviour

Any time a chart is:

Generated or updated with:

A custom date range and/or

Additional tickers (e.g. ARGX) or overlays,

The current chart state should be:

Saved or updated in the Chart History Log as a card.

That history card should restore:

Base ticker

All added tickers (e.g. ARGX)

Date range

Any overlays/annotations

Acceptance criteria

With ARGX added and date range Aug 20, 2025 – Sep 02, 2025:

I should see a Chart History card created/updated.

Clicking that card should bring me back to:

The same date range

The same tickers (including ARGX)

The same chart view.

2. Bug: Extra ticker tag appearing in the wrong place

Problem

After adding a ticker (e.g. ARGX), there are two ticker tags.

One tag appears correctly where ticker tags/overlays should live.

A second tag is appearing between the Clear All and Export buttons in the toolbar which is where the +Add Ticker search unit is appearing, which is incorrect. the +Add Ticker search unit need to be in a lightbox type pop and should not move the UI components Clear All and Export 

Expected behaviour

Each added ticker should generate exactly one tag in the ticker/overlay tag area only.

No ticker tags should appear inline in the main toolbar between Clear All and Export.

Acceptance criteria

Adding ARGX:

Shows one ARGX tag, in the correct tag container and position.

Clear All and Export remain adjacent, with no tag between them.

Removing ARGX via its tag/bin removes:

The ARGX overlay from the chart

The single tag from the tag area

No UI elements in the toolbar are affected.
