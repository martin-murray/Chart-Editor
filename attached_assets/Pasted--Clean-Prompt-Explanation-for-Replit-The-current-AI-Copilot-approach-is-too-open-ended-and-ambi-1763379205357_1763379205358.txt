✅ Clean Prompt / Explanation for Replit

The current AI Copilot approach is too open-ended, and ambiguity causes it to fail.
Instead of relying on the AI to interpret free-text and unstructured data, let’s simplify the system.

The easiest, most reliable solution:
→ Allow the user to upload or paste a clean CSV file containing only date,value data
→ The system (not the AI) parses it
→ The AI only needs to confirm or describe the overlay, NOT interpret the data

This makes it:

Consistent

Predictable

Impossible for AI to misread

Much easier to implement

🟦 The new, simple feature to add to the Price Chart
Feature: “Upload Overlay Data (CSV or Paste)”

Users can:

Upload a .csv

Or paste text (date,value pairs)

Example:

2025-06-06,0.0255
2025-06-09,0.0325
2025-07-01,0.1165
2025-09-19,1

System behaviour (NO ambiguity):

Parse the CSV → list of {date, value}

Convert each value to % (value × 100)

Plot the overlay as a line between 0% (bottom) and 100% (top)

The line overlays the stock price

The overlay uses the same x-axis dates → aligns with the timeframe

The y-axis is fixed for overlay:

bottom = 0%

top = 100%

Why this works

No free-form instructions

No complex interpretation

No “AI guesswork”

100% deterministic behaviour

Users already know how to paste / upload simple data

🟩 Optional: the AI still helps, but only lightly

All the AI needs to do now:

Confirm it received the file or pasted data

Say “Overlay uploaded successfully”

Maybe describe what the curve looks like (optional)

But it does NOT interpret, does NOT parse, and does NOT decide line colour, does NOT guess anything.

AI becomes a helper instead of a parser.

🟧 Use this as the Replit AI Prompt (short, ready to paste):

This tool allows the user to upload or paste a CSV containing date/value pairs (percentage data).
Your job is NOT to interpret or transform data — the system does that.
You only confirm the overlay was loaded and optionally describe what the user should expect to see.
The price chart automatically:
– Parses the CSV
– Converts values to percentages
– Plots the series as a 0–100% overlay line
– Aligns the line with the stock price timeline.
If the user asks for help, explain how to upload or paste data, but never guess or modify the numbers.

🟪 If you want the simplest possible workflow for users:
✔ Add a button: “Add % Overlay”

When clicked:

User chooses:

Upload CSV

Paste data

System parses automatically

Overlay appears

No AI needed for the core function

This is the lowest-risk, fastest, and most user-friendly approach.
