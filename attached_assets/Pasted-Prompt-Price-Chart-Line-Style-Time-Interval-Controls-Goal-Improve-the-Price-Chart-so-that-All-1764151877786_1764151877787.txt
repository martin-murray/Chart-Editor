Prompt: Price Chart Line Style + Time Interval Controls

Goal

Improve the Price Chart so that:

All lines are straight, angular segments (no smoothing or rounded curves).

Users can choose the time interval for price data: 15m, 1h, 3h, 6h.

The system applies layout logic so interval choices stay realistic for the selected date range.

The chart no longer connects just the daily open/close – it uses higher-resolution price points based on the chosen interval.

1. Line rendering

Render all price lines as straight line segments between actual data points.

Disable any curve smoothing / interpolation (no bezier, no “rounded” edges).

The visual style should clearly show point-to-point moves, not a softened curve.

2. Interval UI

Add a Time Interval control to the Price Chart, ideally as a dropdown:

Options: 15 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours.

The selected interval controls how dense the price data is along the line:

15 min → most detailed line

1 hour / 3 hours / 6 hours → progressively fewer points

3. Behaviour when the user changes interval

When the user selects an interval:

Re-fetch or re-aggregate the underlying time series to that interval.

Re-render the price line using those interval points only.

Result: the line becomes more detailed at smaller intervals, and simpler at larger intervals.

4. Layout / range logic

The system should prevent silly combinations of very long ranges + ultra-dense intervals.

Example logic (you can tune the exact thresholds):

For ranges up to 7 days → allow 15m, 1h, 3h, 6h.

For ranges around 1 month → hide or disable 15m, allow 1h, 3h, 6h.

For ranges longer than 3 months → only show 3h and 6h, or default to a daily aggregation instead.

If the user changes the date range and the current interval is no longer valid:

Auto-switch to the closest valid interval and show a subtle note if needed.

5. Fix current behaviour

Right now the weekly view is “basic” because it effectively connects only open and close for a period.

Update this so that:

Weekly (or any custom) view uses intraday points according to the selected interval, not just start/end prices.

The line should step through all interval timestamps over the selected range.

One-liner version (for a shorter system prompt)

“Render all price chart lines as unsmoothed straight segments between real data points, add a Time Interval dropdown (15m, 1h, 3h, 6h) that controls the density of price data, and apply simple date-range logic so very long ranges don’t allow ultra-fine intervals; stop using only open/close for a week and instead use interval-based intraday points.”
