🔧 Implementation Brief — New Chart Pathway Cards & Nav Update
🎯 Overview

We are replacing the current Global Stock and ETF Search unit with three interactive cards.
These will serve as clear entry points for users into the three main pathways of the app’s functionality.

Each card should:

Be clickable and link directly to its respective page.

Include a title and description copy.

Be visually balanced, using our standard card layout, iconography, and motion where appropriate.

We’ll also add a new “Chart Type” dropdown in the top navigation to help users switch easily between chart modes when on any of the respective pages.

🧭 Navigation Update: Chart Type Dropdown

Add a Chart Type dropdown in the top nav with the following options:

Price Chart

Comparison Chart

AI Co-Pilot

When a user selects a chart type, it should route them to the appropriate view.
